To use MHDDOS more precisely, you can use the following options:

-t option: This option specifies the IP address of the target of the attack. For example, if you enter mhddos syn -t 192.168.0.1, it will execute a SYN flood attack against the target IP address 192.168.0.1.
-n option: This option specifies the size of the network to be used for the attack. For example, if you enter mhddos syn -t 192.168.0.1 -n 100, it will create a network of 100 machines and use them to execute a SYN flood attack against the target IP address.
-p option: This option specifies the port number of the target service. For example, if you enter mhddos syn -t 192.168.0.1 -p 80, it will execute a SYN flood attack against port 80 of the target IP address.
These are just a few examples of the options that you can use with MHDDOS. Refer to the MHDDOS documentation for more information on the available options and how to use them.
